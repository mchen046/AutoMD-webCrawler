To do this you made need to poke the pointed end of the test light into the wires that are going to the window motor.",

If the switch appears to be melted or burnt anywhere you will need to replace the switch, and bring your vehicle to a professional to find the root cause of the problem burnt or melted leads and connectors usually means there is a more serious wiring problem."

Wheel balancing is done to compensate for heavy spots of  the wheel and tire, if your wheels are bent or chipped this can cause your wheel to be out of balance. Wheel weights are adhered or clipped to the wheel rim to compensate for these differences. Irregular tire wear is also a symptom of a wheel not being balanced.",

Otherwise, if you have direct access to tire/wheel balancing equipment, follow the manufacturers instructions to complete the process.",

The weights are specifically designed for different rim/wheel applications. If performing this procedure on your own, pay close attention to the type of  wheel weights necessary and make sure final readings reach optimum wheel/rim balance.",
                    "7) After the wheel/rim is balanced, check the rim/wheel for possible damage. In some cases, the wheel/rim may be bent or cracked beyond repair, causing the steering wheel to pulsate and experience rough road drivability. If this issue is present, it will be necessary to replace the entire rim/wheel assembly.",

Using an infrared thermometer check the temperature at the upper and lower radiator hose. If you do not have an infrared thermometer you can use your hands to test the temperature of the hoses, make sure to be careful of the moving parts of the engine. After several minutes the hoses should begin to get hot, take note of the upper radiator hose. This hose should all at once begin to warm up letting you know the thermostat has opened and the hot coolant is going from the engine to the radiator to be cooled. If several minutes pass and the hose does not get hot, check the engine temperature inside the vehicle if it is climbing and beginning to over heat shut the vehicle down, the problem is the thermostat is stuck closed."

The other function is for colder climates, during the cold winter months the temperature can fall well below freezing, the coolant/antifreeze has to stay in a liquid state, if there was only water in the system the water would freeze and expand causing damage to the engine.",

Using the connector end that goes to the fan you will need to jump power to the leads either use jumper wires from the battery or the use of a powered test light. Apply power to the fan the fan should begin to spin, if the fan does not then the fan motor is not functioning and will need to be replaced. If the fan does turn on then the problem is in the electronic fan control system. Repeat the test if the vehicle has two electric cooling fans.",

If the fan clutch has never been replaced the best course of action is to start there."

                "description" : "The clutch pedal return spring permits full release of the clutch pedal and reduces linkage slack due to wear. As the linkage wears, clutch free pedal travel will increase and free travel will decrease as the clutch wears. As the clutch friction material wears, as like brake linings, adjustments and lubrication of certain components are necessary. If there is too much free-play, the clutch will not engage fully. If there is too little, the pressure plate will ride against the clutch all the time and the clutch will wear out prematurely.",
